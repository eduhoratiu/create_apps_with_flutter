# create_apps_with_flutter

Welcome to "Create Apps with Flutter," the GitHub repository supporting our course on mobile app development using Flutter and Dart. This course, designed with practicality at its core, is a step-by-step guide to mastering the creation of mobile applications from concept to deployment.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll start from the basics of Flutter and Dart and advance to building complete mobile applications ready for the Google Play Store. The learning path is designed to be hands-on, with immediate application of concepts in practical projects.

`flutter_app_1` is our starting point, where you'll write your first lines of UI code directly within the main function. With `flutter_app_2`, we expand our horizons, organizing our project into separate files for screens, modules, and widgets.

By the end of this course, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to craft intuitive and performant apps and publish them for Android users worldwide, with an awareness that the skills you're developing are also applicable to other platforms thanks to Flutter's cross-platform capabilities.

## Repository Structure

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

- **[flutter_app_1](flutter_app_1)**: Our initial project, where the focus is on getting acquainted with Flutter by writing UI code in the main function.
- **[flutter_app_2](flutter_app_2)**: The second phase of our learning where we begin to structure our code into different files, encouraging modularity and maintainability.

This repository will evolve with more directories and examples as we progress through the course.
